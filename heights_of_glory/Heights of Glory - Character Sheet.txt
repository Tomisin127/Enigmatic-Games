HEIGHTS OF GLORY -- Character Sheet

				STATS
STRENGTH -- This is how strong the character is. This affects how
slow the character will be while carrying a heavy object. A weak
character will be noticeably slower while carrying a heavy object
as opposed to a strong character. This also affects how many weapons
and/or ammo clips a character can hold simultaneously.

SPEED -- This is how fast a character moves. This is directly
affected by strength and weight.

WEIGHT # doesn't need to be displayed in the CHARACTER SELECTION
MENU # -- This the weight of a player. A heavy player should be
slower than a skinny player.

ENDURANCE -- This is how easily a character is killed. It's
different from the amount of health a character has. All
characters have a standard health gauge but their ENDURANCEs
differ. 


------------------------------------------------------------------


				UPGRADES
The STRENGTH, SPEED and ENDURANCE stats can be upgraded by using
the points gotten while playing the game. Say the max of each stat
is 100.


------------------------------------------------------------------


				STORYLINE
A certain city in the world (could be anywhere) has been hit by a
zombie epidemic. A special agency has been set up in the past
for the control of such situations, so agents from the agency are
sent into the city to help rescue the few people who have
survived, retrieve important documents [or other objects] and
exterminate the zombies and therefore end the epidemic...

------------------------------------------------------------------

ACCESSORIES (???)
# This is stuff the user can buy for his characters to wear but
this would require EXTRA art for each accessory in relation to the
character... Not sure if we should do that. Just a suggestion #

POP CULTURE REFERENCES (???)
#Well, our game as characters and enemies .. Let's assume the player
isn't touching the joystick to move the character for a while, the
character starts to dance or dooes something related to what everyone
in this present age/generation can relate with. 


We could also make the zombies walk in a funny way. We could also have
fake humans in the game. The way they is that as a you get closer to them
they transform to zombies... Let's say a zombie kills the player... All the
zombies will go to their base and gather to jubilate (this could be a
animation or a video in the game) after the players' death... #
