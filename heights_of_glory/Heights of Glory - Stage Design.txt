HEIGHTS OF GLORY -- Stage Design

STORY MODE -- Objective
MAIN Objective
In the story mode, the player tries to overcome and kill zombies
on the way to the top of the structure s/he finds him/herself in,
where they'll have a boss fight and then be extracted by a
helicopter.

ADDITIONAL Objectives
GEM RUSH Stage
The objective is to collect as many gems while climbing to the top
of the building.

# Alternative GEM RUSH Stage ??? #
In this stage, it plays as a fully horizontal stage where the player
is automatically running towards the right side of the screen (like
Jetpack Joyride, although this one won't be infinite) while shooting
zombies and collecting as many gems as possible. The objective in this
stage would be to get a specified number of points (and/or gems) before
the stage comes to an end.

SEARCH AND RESCUE Stage
The objective is to rescue a civilian(s) and get them to the extraction
point. You lose if the civilian(s) is/are killed or the player him/herself
dies.

SURVIVAL MODE
The objective in this stage is to survive as long as possible. We can have
a Google Play Games integration with this so that there can be a Leaderboard.
(The Google Play Games integration should also allow the user to save his
progress, the same way its done in other games, eg. Clash of Clans, Brawl
Stars, NOVA Legacy, etc.)

# MULTIPLAYER MODE  ???#
# CO-OP MULTIPLAYER MODE #
In this scenario, two (or more) players fight play as teammates while clearing
the building (or whatever structure) of all the zombies (and/or if it's a SEARCH
AND RESCUE Stage, rescuing several civilians). This may be either HOTSPOT or
ONLINE MULTIPLAYER.

# VERSUS MULTIPLAYER MODE #
In this scenario, two (or more) players go head-to-head in a battle to capture as
many positions as possible. The way it works is that, both players start on
opposite sides of the ground floor. Then a random, neutral post will be located
in the building. When a player stands on the post for 5 seconds, he gets a certain
number of points (let's say 10). If he is killed or moves from the post he doesn't
get the points. The post will be available for a total of 60 seconds (provided the
maximum points that can be attained from the post are not attained) ## I may need to
explain some more about this ##
